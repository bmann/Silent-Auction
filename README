Silent Auction
==============

A simple silent auction system implemented using the Drupal Features module.

Peter Rukavina (http://twitter.com/ruk) made a post for his recipe 
for running a silent auction using Drupal: http://ruk.ca/content/how-run-a-silent-auction-using-drupal 

I took the recipe and turned it into a feature, and added his custom code to 
the generated silent_auction.module code.

See the demo / development site at http://silentauction.bmannconsulting.com

Installation
==============

The codebase is best obtained using Drush Make:

$ wget http://github.com/rypalmer/builds/raw/master/silent_auction.make
$ drush make silent_auction.make silent_auction

Follow the standard Drupal installation method way by browsing to http://127.0.0.1/silent-auction or the IP address or domain name of your server, and following the prompts.

TO DO
==============

* BUG: the block code doesn't currently work
* BUG: the string overrides module isn't currently exportable
* FEATURE: should add some views and blocks showing recent bids
* FEATURE: combine it with some views / templates / themes that show bids 
           in a better format than default comments
